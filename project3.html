                <p>LaTeX (pronounced "Lay-tech" or "Lah-tech") is a high-quality typesetting system commonly used for producing scientific and technical documents. It is based on the TeX typesetting system created by Donald Knuth. LaTeX provides a set of macros and commands that allow authors to focus on the content of their documents while the system handles the layout and formatting.</p>
                <ul>
                    LaTeX was developed in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport as a set of macros for the TeX typesetting system. Here is a brief timeline of its development:
                    <li><span class="bold">1978:</span> Donald Knuth creates TeX, a typesetting system designed to produce beautifully formatted books, particularly those with complex mathematical content.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1984:</span> Leslie Lamport releases LaTeX, which builds on TeX by providing a higher-level language with commands for common formatting tasks. LaTeX makes it easier for users to create complex documents without needing to delve into the more intricate aspects of TeX.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">1994:</span> LaTeX2e is released as the standard version of LaTeX, providing a more stable and extensible framework.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">2000s-present:</span> LaTeX continues to be maintained and extended by the LaTeX Project Team, with numerous packages developed by the community to add functionality.</li>
                </ul>

                    LaTeX is widely used in academia, especially in fields that require the inclusion of complex mathematical expressions, such as mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, and economics. Its primary uses include:
                    <li><span class="bold">Scientific Research Papers:</span>LaTeX is the de facto standard for formatting research papers due to its ability to handle complex mathematical notations and its support for citation management.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Theses and Dissertations:</span>Many universities provide LaTeX templates for students to ensure consistent formatting of theses and dissertations.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Books and Articles:</span>Authors of technical books and articles use LaTeX to produce documents with professional-quality typesetting.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Presentations:</span>With packages like Beamer, LaTeX can be used to create professional presentations.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Resumes and CVs:</span>LaTeX can be used to create visually appealing and well-structured resumes and CVs.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Letters and Reports:</span>LaTeX provides classes and templates for writing formal letters and reports.</li>

                    The '\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{filename}' command is used to include an image file. The width=\textwidth option scales the image to the width of the text.

                    The '\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} ... \end{tabular}' environment is used to create the actual table. The {|c|c|c|} argument specifies the number of columns and their alignment (centered in this case), with vertical lines between them.
                    The \hline command creates a horizontal line across the table.
                    Table cells are separated by the & symbol, and rows are ended with \\.

                    For larger equations or those that need to be centered, the '\begin{equation} ... \end{equation}' environment can be used. The '\[...\]' environment can also be used for unnumbered displayed equations.

\section{Inline Math}
Inline math is used when mathematical expressions are included within a line of text. For example, the quadratic formula is given by $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. Another example is the equation for the circumference of a circle, which is $C = 2 \pi r$ where $r$ is the radius.

\section{Display Math}
Display math is used for larger equations or those that need to be centered on their own line. These equations are usually more complex and benefit from being set apart from the main text.
The quadratic formula can be displayed as follows:
    \begin{equation}
        x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
    \end{equation}
